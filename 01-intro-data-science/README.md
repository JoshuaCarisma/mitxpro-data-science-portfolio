# Module 01: Introduction to Data Science

## Objective
This module introduces the foundational mindset of a data scientist, focusing on how usable data can be overlooked and how to frame real-world observations as structured, actionable data. It also examines the five-layer modeling framework and how data impacts decision-making in practice.

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Articulate a scenario where usable data may be overlooked and how to transform it into value
- Discuss how data and signals are generated, shared, and owned in different systems
- Apply the five modeling layers within a business or clinical example
- Generate and interpret basic summary statistics using Python
- Identify and explain Simpson’s Paradox in context
- Understand the broader implications of thorough data analysis in business and healthcare

---

## Techniques Covered
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Python-based data description (Pandas)
- Data framing and contextual thinking
- Data modeling concepts
- Simpson’s Paradox

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Conceptual frameworks from MIT

## Personal Reflection

> “With data collection embedded in nearly every aspect of modern life, understanding what *signals* we’re creating — and what’s missing — becomes a critical skill for any analyst or leader.”

This module challenged me to reflect deeply on how data is not just passively collected — it's **actively shaped** by the systems and decisions we build. As a personal trainer and health coach, I’ve often encountered scenarios where **clients fail to see progress**, despite their best efforts. Upon closer inspection, it’s often not their effort that’s lacking — it's that we’re missing *contextual data* that tells a fuller story.

Health outcomes are influenced by complex, less-visible variables: sleep patterns, stress levels, recovery quality, or even food availability. These aren't always tracked, but they *should* be — because they often explain why a plan is or isn't working. When I started encouraging clients to track stress, sleep, and energy, I began uncovering what truly hindered their success. The same lesson applies to AI, healthcare systems, and business operations: **without full-spectrum data, we risk solving the wrong problems**.

> “Data becomes information when it’s contextualized — and information becomes wisdom when it’s acted on appropriately.”

I also explored the issue of **data ownership** and privacy. While we create massive streams of data through daily behavior, it's often the platforms — not the individuals — who extract value from it. Understanding this asymmetry is part of being a responsible data scientist. This module reminded me that ethical and strategic data design starts with understanding what’s possible — and what’s missing.

## Example Case Studies
- **Hospital Discharge Prediction Tool**  
  Explored how overlooked signals (e.g., social factors, home conditions) can improve outcome prediction models
- **Optima vs. Quanta Business Strategy Simulation**  
  Compared performance tradeoffs under different assumptions about data completeness

---

## Key Takeaways
- Valuable data is often overlooked due to assumptions or narrow framing
- Being a good data scientist means **asking better questions**, not just analyzing what's available
- Many systems need **more contextual and human-centered data** to truly optimize
