## Personal Reflection

> “Logistic regression helped me realize that probability, not certainty, is the true language of prediction.”

This module reframed the way I think about decision-making. Many important outcomes in business and healthcare are **binary** — loan default or not, treatment success or failure, client churn or retention. Logistic regression provides a statistically grounded way to **predict outcomes without pretending to know them with certainty**.

Working with the LendingClub dataset, I saw how just a few well-chosen predictors (e.g., credit history, income, loan amount) could produce **probability estimates** that inform policy — like who gets approved or what level of follow-up is needed. The ability to **adjust cutoffs** and use a **confusion matrix** reminded me that a good model isn’t just about accuracy; it’s about what type of error you’re willing to accept.

This has major implications for healthcare, where false negatives might mean missing a diagnosis, while false positives could lead to unnecessary stress and cost. Understanding this trade-off — and being able to **communicate it clearly to stakeholders** — is one of the most powerful skills I’ve developed in this program.

> “A model doesn’t just predict behavior. It shapes it — through policy, communication, and trust.”

## Example Case Studies
- **Loan Default Prediction (LendingClub Dataset)**  
  Built a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of default using financial and behavioral features.  
  Translated coefficients into intuitive insight (e.g., “Higher debt ratio increases likelihood of default”), and tuned decision thresholds for different business needs.

- **Model Evaluation with Confusion Matrix**  
  Compared predicted outcomes vs. actual defaults using a confusion matrix.  
  Assessed accuracy and error rates, and experimented with changing the threshold to improve recall at the cost of precision — depending on scenario goals.

## Key Takeaways
- Logistic regression enables **binary outcome prediction using probability**  
- The sigmoid function transforms linear models into bounded outputs  
- P-values and confidence intervals determine which predictors matter  
- Confusion matrices are key for evaluating **classification quality**  
- Threshold tuning can adapt the model for different decision environments  
- Business application requires not just performance, but interpretability
