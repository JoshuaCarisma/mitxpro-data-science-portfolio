# MIT xPRO Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases my completed work from the **MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Data Science and Analytics (2024)**. The program covered over 24 modules of hands-on, project-based learning with real-world applications across supervised and unsupervised machine learning, optimization, and decision science.

Each folder in this repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that explores a key data science technique, with contextual analysis, visualizations, and Python-based implementations using industry-standard tools.

## About This Portfolio

This project is part of my transition from technical program management into applied data science and advanced analytics. I’m currently applying to graduate programs in **Computer Science** and **Analytics**, and this portfolio represents my technical foundation and problem-solving mindset developed through MIT’s curriculum.
