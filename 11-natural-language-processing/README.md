# Module 11: Natural Language Processing – Word Embeddings, Intent Recognition, and Transformers

## Objective  
This module introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in understanding, classifying, and responding to text-based data. It spans from basic classification models using lyrics and genre prediction to advanced intent recognition and slot-filling using neural networks and transformer architectures. The focus is on transforming text into structured data that supports meaningful decision-making in business, customer service, and personalization systems.

## Learning Outcomes  
- Use vectorization, tokenization, and multi-hot encoding to prepare textual data  
- Train classification models to predict outcomes from raw text  
- Represent words using one-hot vectors, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and positional encodings  
- Build neural networks for text classification and intent recognition  
- Use bigrams to preserve word order and reduce ambiguity  
- Evaluate classification accuracy, precision, and recall  
- Implement transformer-based models for contextual language understanding  
- Design NLP pipelines for search, personalization, and chatbot systems

## Personal Reflection

This was one of the most transformative modules for me — not only because NLP is central to modern AI, but because it’s so directly applicable to my work in coaching, communication, and behavioral modeling.

Building a genre classifier from song lyrics helped me understand how **raw text can be translated into structure** — how even the vague emotional tones of language can become data. When I trained models with GloVe embeddings and watched accuracy improve, I saw the power of **shared meaning between words** emerge through math.

In part two, working on intent recognition took this even further. Predicting not just *what* someone says, but *what they mean* — and then filling in slots (locations, names, times) — suddenly felt like designing the backend of a personalized coaching assistant or virtual intake system.

Using Transformers gave me the next-level capability I needed. Context became king. Ambiguity dropped. Suddenly, I could imagine building systems that read transcripts, interpret needs, and respond just like a human might — but at scale, 24/7.

These ideas aren’t just technical. They’re personal. They’re about building tools that *listen better* — to people, to clients, to systems.

## Example Case Studies  
- **Lyrics Genre Classifier (Multi-hot Neural Network)**  
  Built a baseline model using song lyrics and predicted genre labels with multi-hot encoded vectors. Improved performance using GloVe word embeddings.

- **Intent and Slot Prediction from User Queries**  
  Built a dual-output neural network that predicted intent (e.g., "book flight") and slots (e.g., destination, date). Achieved 94% intent accuracy and 89% slot prediction using custom architecture.

- **Transformer-based Slot Filler**  
  Implemented a Transformer encoder to predict context-dependent slots with 93% accuracy. Used attention-based modeling to improve over simple RNN-style pipelines.

## Key Takeaways  
- NLP turns unstructured language into structured insight  
- Embeddings capture meaning through distance and direction  
- Simple classifiers can perform well — but deep context requires advanced architectures  
- Transformers unlock context-aware understanding at scale  
- These models can be embedded into search systems, chatbots, recommender systems, and coaching platforms
